# Musical Instruments Store

This repository contains a project developed using procedural PHP with the goal of creating a virtual store for musical instruments. The project is designed to explore fundamental concepts of web development with PHP using the procedural approach.

## Project Objective

The objective of this project is to provide a practical experience in developing web applications using procedural PHP. Through this project, the aim is to consolidate knowledge of data manipulation, database interaction, and the implementation of basic functionalities for a virtual store.

## Technologies Used

- **PHP**: Programming language used to develop the backend of the project.
- **HTML/CSS**: For creating the user interface.
- **MySQL**: Database used to store the store's information.
- **XAMPP/WAMP**: For local server configuration.

## Project Structure

The project is composed of multiple PHP files organized to meet the needs of a virtual store system. The file organization reflects the procedural approach, with functions dedicated to specific tasks such as database connection, product display, and transaction processing.

## How to Run the Project

1. Set up the local server:
   - Ensure that XAMPP or WAMP is installed.
   - Place the project files in the `htdocs` folder (XAMPP) or equivalent.

2. Set up the database:
   - Import the SQL file provided in the repository to configure the database.

3. Start the local server:
   - Access the XAMPP or WAMP control panel and start the Apache and MySQL services.

4. Access the project in your browser:
   - Navigate to `http://localhost/project-name`.
